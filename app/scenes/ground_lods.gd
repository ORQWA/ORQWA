## Coarser versions of the chunks' ground for the distance. In towns every street levels the
## ground across it, in pieces of a few metres that far off are smaller than a pixel; Godot draws
## these versions there instead (`WorldMeshes.simplified`). Making them takes seconds for a city,
## so they are made on worker threads: the ground shows in full until they replace it.

## Task id → the ground and a slot for its versions.
